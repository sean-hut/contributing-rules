# Contributing Rules

The purpose of this project is to have general contributing rules for
contributors.  These rules can then be reused by different projects.

As these rules are general they need to be complimented with project
specific rules.  The project specific rules should be located in a
`CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the projects root directory.

# Rule Modules

To help with reuse the rules are in separate readme files.

Here are some examples of projects referencing rule modules in their
contributing section:

- [this project][this-project]
-- Selective uses of rule modules
- [Eping][eping]
-- Selective uses of rule modules
-- Project specific make rule
