# GPG2 Elliptic-Curve Signing Key

This project requires `gpg2` elliptic-curve cryptography signing.

The [GPG][gpg] project recommend [elliptic-curve
cryptography][elliptic-curve]:

> The future is elliptical-curve cryptography, which will bring a
> level of safety comparable to RSA-16384.

> Frankly, we think ECC is a really good idea
